Project Title:
LSB Image Stenography 

Project Overview:
This project implements steganography, a technique that hides secret information within ordinary objects, making the hidden data undetectable to the naked eye. Specifically, this project focuses on encoding a secret file (e.g., a text file, document, or binary data) into an image file by modifying its pixel values subtly. The goal is to develop a system that can embed any file into an image without significantly altering the visual appearance of the image.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide a way to securely transmit sensitive information using images as the carrier medium. The encoded image looks identical to the original, making it an ideal method for covert communication. Only someone with the appropriate decoding mechanism can extract the hidden data.
